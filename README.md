# Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance Landscape

This repository contains the data files and images required to generate the [PQCA landscape](https://pqca.landscape2.io). The software that generates it can be found at the [cncf/landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) repository. Please see its [README file](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2#landscape2) for more information about how it works.

## New entries

To add a new entry to the landscape, please open a pull request to add it in alphabetical order to the [landscape.yml](landscape.yml) file. The logo must be added to the `hosted_logos` directory (in SVG format) and referenced from the `logo` field.

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment the landscape is generated daily, so once your PR is merged your changes should be visible before 24 hours.

## Corrections

If you find an error in the landscape, please open a pull request with the suggested changes to the [landscape.yml](landscape.yml) file. Some information displayed in the landscape is obtained from Crunchbase or GitHub, so errors on it should be fixed in the corresponding source.
